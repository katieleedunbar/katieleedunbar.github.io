Dealing with Normative Gaze in Performance Art

NGinPA Collective’ ‚(Female) Collective dealing with Normative Gaze in Performance Art‘
how some of us defined our collective

•	We understand the collective as a common ground, where we share questions, concept, experience and practice relating to the topic of Normative Gaze from the perspective of “female” identifies people. 
•	We deal with questions such as “What does it mean (either by ourselves or by others) to be identified as a woman, on stage and as an artist? What are our questions related to our own practices?“ 
•	The collective is a place for inquiry. We strive to build together a safe space where we can share our questions with each other and be aware of the diversity of discourses and strategies to relate to the normative. 
•	The collective can become a site of collaboration, skill sharing, tool swapping, experimentation and re-thinking of our own reflection and practice. 
•	Our collective work is an artistic research. We use body, movement, and performance practice to develop states of being. “To deal with” is a search for presence. 
•	„Show me your material and I’ll show you what you are not doing with it“ : we are entering a mutual exchange of approaches and strategies.

NGinPA OPEN DISCUSSION
@Hub of Month of Performance Art Berlin, Holzmarkt Theater der Zukunft
13th May 2014

Facilitated by Melanie Jame Wolf

Within this frame, we have brainstrormed the following questions : 
1. What is the normative gaze? What would be an example of how it affects me personally, as a person in everyday life and as a performer/maker?
2. What is my responsibility as a maker, performer or audience member in relation to the normative gaze and its reproduction? 
3. Which tools and strategies can we develop to identify, deal with and respond to the normative gaze? 
4. What are the alternatives to the normative gaze? 
5. What is my own normative gaze upon myself and upon others? 
6. How does my body internalizes or incorporates the normative gaze? 
7. How can we work inclusively taking into consideration cultural differences and different perceptions of concepts?

NGinPA, a Berlin-based collective dealing with the "Normative Gaze" in Performance Art. Was initiated by Anaïs Héraud and Katie Dunbar and has presented its first performance at the venue WestGermany in the frame of the Month of Performance Art Berlin. Specifically exploring gendered notions of both performance and perception in art, the group's diverse experiences and opinions come together to put forth new and challenging ideas. The piece is the product of a weeklong process of creative collaboration of NGinPA's performance artists, dancers musicians, writers, and visual artists hailing from Germany, Italy, Argentina, UK, USA, France, Poland, Romania, Australia and Israel. Though the collective was formed through a call put out specifically for the Month of Performance Art Berlin, the group plans to continue its work indefinitely.
