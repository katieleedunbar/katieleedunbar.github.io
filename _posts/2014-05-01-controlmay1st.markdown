A microscope on a bigger topic:  
I divided up the space while improvising with 30 questions about control as I divided up the space I crossed over a pile of sand.  
As I met audience members I asked them: "Can I ask you a few questions about control?" Then I asked them to follow me as I divided up the space with red parcel ribbon.  
Some example of the 30 questions I ask are:  
When do you feel controlled?   
Where does comprised end and control begin?   
Do you think the space we are allocated is a way to control us?  
Do you think humans need to be controlled to be safe?   
What happens when someone loses control?  
Is control only destructive?  
Is control ever constructive?   
Do you know when you are controlling a conversation?  
Do you ever think about control?  
.... and so on for 30....  
I'm always crossed over the pile of sand in the center.  
Once I have crossed the pile of sand many times. I stopped asking the questions and slowly, I start move the lines into the sand. The effect of this action is you see it but don't see the red parcel ribbon move into the sand. It moves into the sand cuts through it but you barely see its traces.  
At some point I leave the space and the audience is left in the midst of the piece with the sand in the middle.
