Reflektor is an event series focusing on the interplay between performance and sound art.

Our next event will happen on the 18th of September @Westgermany, Xberg!
Artists and more infos soon.

In May 2013 the Reflektor event series was born with the aim to bring together performers and musicians and their audiences. The need for this cross pollination was clear in observing our artistic life and how performance and sound art seem to progress parallel but rarely intersect. We find it essential to create a common platform for practice exchange and shared research.

Our aim is to encourage and inspire interplay and experimentation in each other´s practice, leaving the confined structures of the different artistic fields and reaching a wider audience. The event takes place quarterly migrating through venues in Berlin.
